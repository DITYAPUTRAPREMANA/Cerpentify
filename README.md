# **Cerpentify - Short Story Platform**

Cerpentify is a web-based platform where users can explore, read, and share short stories (cerpen) in various genres. It provides a seamless experience for users to read stories, upload their own creations, and engage with other writers through reviews and ratings. The platform offers personalized features such as saving stories to personal collections and interacting with others via a commenting system.

## **Features**

* **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
* **Story Exploration**: Browse and search for short stories by title, category, and author.
* **Upload Stories**: Users can upload their own stories, choose categories, and share them with the community.
* **Review System**: Readers can leave reviews and rate stories, providing feedback for authors.
* **Collection Management**: Users can save their favorite stories to personal collections for easy access.
* **Responsive UI**: Designed with responsiveness in mind for a smooth experience across devices.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface, styled with TailwindCSS.
* **Backend**: Firebase for database management, authentication, and storage.
* **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for secure user login and sign-up.
* **Cloud Storage**: Firebase Firestore for storing and managing user data and stories.

## **How It Works**

### **Dashboard**

### **Login/Registration**

* New users can **sign up** for an account, while returning users can **log in** to access their personalized dashboard, upload stories, and manage their collections.

### **Story Upload**

* Authenticated users can upload their own stories to the platform. They are required to provide a **title**, **content**, and **category** before submitting their work.

### **Reading and Reviewing Stories**

* Users can read stories, leave reviews, and rate the stories. All reviews and ratings are stored in Firestore, and users can view the total number of reviews for each story.

## **Usage**

   * After logging in, users can browse stories, leave reviews, and add stories to their personal collections.
2. **Upload Stories**:
